<img class="avatar-width fr w6" src="/images/avatar-sm.jpg"> I am an experienced professional developer with a passion for quality software.  I have experience in java, kotlin, spring and spring boot along with the full J2EE suite which all gives me an extensive toolkit to draw from. I have significant experience in test-driven development and stringent source and release management processes.  I am comfortable working either as part of a bigger development team or as a solo developer.

I am constantly learning and extending my skills. I contribute to open-source projects and write about software development.  I am skilled in both server-side and front-end technologies and experienced with agile practices such as scrum, pair programming and continuous integration.

I have worked on projects for the NHS, as well as major banks and building societies in the UK.  In 2007 I took on the responsibility of caring for his son and foundered a new digital marketing business to enable him to run this from home. 

I am the founder of the [Brighton Kotlin Meetup](https://BrightonKotlin.com) - a group for Kotlin users, enthusiasts and learners from beginners to experts, and anyone wanting to get involved with the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem.

My specialties are in Java/Kotlin microservice architectures, test-driven development, agile software development, Spring and Spring Boot.
