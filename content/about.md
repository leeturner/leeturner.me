I am an experienced software engineer with over 20 years experience working on large scale software implementations and have a passion for well crafted, pragmatically tested software. I am currently working at [Crunch](https://medium.com/@crunchtech) as their Lead Backend Developer and have significant experience in Java, Kotlin and Spring Boot along with test-driven development and stringent source and release management processes. I am also experienced with agile practices such as scrum, pair programming and continuous integration.

I am constantly learning and extending my skills and am able to become proficient in new languages quickly. I contribute to open-source projects and write and present about software development and software testing and I am comfortable working either as part of a bigger development team or as a solo developer.

I am the founder of the [Brighton Kotlin](https://brightonkotlin.com) and [Brighton JUG](https://www.meetup.com/brighton-jug/) meetup groups where we bring Kotlin and Java users, enthusiasts and learners from beginners to experts, and anyone wanting to get involved with the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem together to learn and support each other.

My specialties are in Java & Kotlin microservice architectures using Spring Boot, test-driven development and agile software development.
