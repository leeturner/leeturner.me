<img class="avatar" src="/images/avatar-sm.jpg"/> 

I am an experienced professional developer with a passion for quality software.  I am currently working at [Crunch](https://medium.com/@crunchtech) as their Lead Backend Developer. I have experience in java, kotlin, spring and spring boot along with the full J2EE suite which all gives me an extensive toolkit to draw from. I have significant experience in test-driven development and stringent source and release management processes.  I am comfortable working either as part of a bigger development team or as a solo developer.

I am constantly learning and extending my skills. I contribute to open-source projects and write and present about software development and software testing.  While my specialties are definitely in backend development, I can put my hand to frontend technologies if required, and I am also experienced with agile practices such as scrum, pair programming and continuous integration.

I am the founder of the [Brighton Kotlin Meetup](https://BrightonKotlin.com) - a group for Kotlin users, enthusiasts and learners from beginners to experts, and anyone wanting to get involved with the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem.

My specialties are in Java/Kotlin microservice architectures, test-driven development, agile software development, Spring and Spring Boot. More recently I am having a play with Kotlin focused technologies like [Ktor](https://ktor.io)
