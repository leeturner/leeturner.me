Welcome to the Brighton Kotlin meetup group. I set up this group in 2019 for Kotlin users, enthusiasts and learners from beginners to experts, and anyone wanting to get involved with the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem in the local Brighton area.  Due to COVID-19, we decided to move the meetups online in 2021 and are now enjoying speakers from further afield than Brighton which has been great for the local community.

We have regular meetups, presentations and talks, and are always interested in hearing what people want to know about, so please let us know.

Visit our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Kotlin/) and sign up to come along to our next event or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brightonkotlin) for all the latest news.
