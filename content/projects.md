Here you can find a collection of side projects I have built for myself or others.  Your mileage might vary, but you are welcome to dig in and have a play if they are useful to you.

## Hugo Progression Framework
Hugo Progression is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template that can render progression frameworks using the same data format as the [Monzo progression framework](https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework) - find out more information in this [blog post](/posts/hugo-progression-framework/)

## BlinkyTapeTestWatcher
[BlinkyTapeTestWatcher](https://github.com/leeturner/BlinkyTapeTestWatcher) is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) based implementation of the [Junit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) [TestWatcher API](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.5.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/TestWatcher.html) that hooks up your tests to a BlinkyTape LED strip - find out more information in this [blog post](/posts/blinkytape-junit-testwatcher/)

## pinboard2markdown
[pinboard2markdown](https://github.com/leeturner/pinboard2markdown) is a command line tool written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [Spring Boot](https://start.spring.io) that communicates with the [pinboard.in api](https://pinboard.in/api/) to retrieve a selection of bookmarks that are tagged with a specified tag.  It then converts those bookmarks to markdown and outputs them to the terminal.

Because I built this for myself it isn't yet packaged up as a command line tool that can be easily downloaded and used.  If you are a developer familiar with Kotlin or Java technologies that you can clone the github repo and build the project.  If there is any interest I will release a formal version of the project and make it so it can be run just like any other command line tool.

I use this tool to build regular newsletters for the backend developers at [Crunch](https://medium.com/@crunchtech) and to generate my [Geek Reads](/tags/bookmarks/) posts
