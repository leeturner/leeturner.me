Well, what can I say?  It has been nearly a year to the day that I posted my original [Hello World post](/posts/hello-world) and I think it is fair to say that there hasn't been a great deal of activity since.

That isn't to say that it hasn't been an extremely busy 2018.  I just completely failed to write about any of it which is a shame.  2018 was filled with some pretty cool stuff:

* Promotions at work
* Building some cool microservices with Spring Boot 2x
* Taking a deep dive into Spring Security
* Playing around with the new features in Junit5
* Presenting a number of tech talks (Junit5, Mutation Testing and Fn Project) to the engineering team at work
* Building a few Raspberry Pi projects
* Building a prototype chatbot
* Dabbling in a little machine learning

All of the above would have generated some great content.  On top of all of that there are still a load of projects that I didn't get round to starting.  Lots to do in 2019.

So, I don't do New Years resolutions, but I am committing to writing more about what I am up to - for no other reason than so I have a reference in January 2020 to look back on.

Here is to a busy 2019 :)
