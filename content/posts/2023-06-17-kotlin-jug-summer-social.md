We will be taking a break from our usual schedule of talks to get both our meetups together with an IRL social and kick off the summer with a few drinks at the Foundary pub in Brighton.

Come and join us by signing up on either the [Brighton Kotlin](https://www.meetup.com/brighton-kotlin/events/293905840/) or [Brighton JUG](https://www.meetup.com/brighton-jug/events/293905213/) meetup pages.
