Well, it has been quite a while since I've had a personal site up and running but given I am back in the dev world full-time, now seemed like a good time to kick one off again.

At the moment I have no idea where this site is going to go but at the very least it will be a place for me to document what I am working on and the things I am playing around with - more for my reference than anything else but hopefully there might be some use for others as well.  

It will very much be targeted towards my primary developer stack so things like Java, Spring, Spring Boot, J2EE and maybe a bit of mobile dev thrown in for good measure.  All with a little sprinkling of TDD, BDD, Agile and Scrum.

Welcome along for the ride :)
