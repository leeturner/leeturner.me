In this post I am going to document how I go about creating a new template for this site.  As I have link:/blog/2017/09/do-you-bake-or-fry.html[talked about previously], I am using http://www.jbake.org[jBake] to create this website and I plan on creating a completely new template using the http://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf] template engine.  There are a number of reasons for me doing this:

* To learn Thymeleaf as I have never used it before
* To provide a resource for myself and others who are building templates for jBake
* To move towards defining a standard set of features that jBake templates should implement
* To provide a standard data set (posts and pages etc) that can be used to test a new jBake template
* To provide a standard set of jBake properties that can be used across multiple templates.

== Getting Started
I am going to start from scratch using the https://html5up.net/editorial[Editorial] template by https://html5up.net[html5up].  Downloading and unzipping the template gives you the following:

As you can see, there is an 'assets' folder containing all the css and javascript etc.  jBake also has a folder called 'assets':

The assets directory is where you should place your static files such as images, CSS files and JavaScript files etc. These files are copied over to the baked output as is. You can create any directory structure you like in the assets directory and this structure will be maintained when copied.

So this is as simple as copying the contents of the template 'assets' folder to the jBake 'assets' folder.  However, here we come to our first design decision.  Using content management systems such as Wordpress or b2Evolution there is a separation of 'theme' assets and 'site' assets.  By this I mean the images etc used by the template are kept completely separate to the images etc used by you in your blog posts.  This makes sense when you think about it because at some point I may want to used a completely different template with my jBake site and if I don't keep everything separate I will have to pick out my blog/site assets from the assets used by my template.
