## What I'm doing /now

Inspired by [Derek Sivers's now page](https://sive.rs/now) this is where you can find out what I'm doing now. You can
find out more about `/now` pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

Last updated: June 19, 2023, from Brighton, UK.

### My Communities

I currently run two local meetups in Brighton - [Brighton Kotlin](https://brightonkotlin.com)
and [Brighton JUG](https://brightonjug.com) where we bring Kotlin and Java users, enthusiasts
and learners from beginners to experts, and anyone wanting to get involved with the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem together to
learn and support each other.

### My Day Job

I currently work for [Crown Agents Bank](https://www.crownagentsbank.com/) where our business goal is “Moving money
where it’s needed”. My team and I work in the payments domain where we build high volume payment processing APIs and
systems.
