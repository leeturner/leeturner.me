Had a play with the @junitteam TestWatcher API today. Hooked it up to my Blinky Tape LED strip for a visual representation of my test status. Green for all tests passing, red for any failures and orange for all passing but some tests disabled. <video controls="" src="/img/x//1371143550348505093-X1AXj9WJS3FQAQSQ.mp4?tag=12" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: black;">
