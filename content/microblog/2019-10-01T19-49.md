The Rottingdean Krakens are kicking off October with their final charity swim of the year. Inspired by @RossEdgley and the Sink or Swim team, we are once again swimming the channel - this time in aid of @CR_UK.  Please help if you can - https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/lees-giving-page-12009
