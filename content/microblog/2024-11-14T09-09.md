Even though LinkedIn jumped the gun a little, it is my 1 year anniversary at WireMock next week. The team has built some
awesome dev tooling over the course of the last year - tooling that I wish I had access to in previous projects -
OpenAPI, stateful mocking, mocks using your own data, gRPC and more. Not only that, it has been great to be a part of an
active open source project with a great community behind it.
