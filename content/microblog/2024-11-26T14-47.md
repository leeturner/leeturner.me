Can't believe that [Adevnt of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) starts on Monday. Also great to see the Kotlin videos
sheduled in already.

I'll be at a conference the first week of December so I'll be playing catchup for the first few days.  If you can, be 
sure to sponsor or buy some merch for the Advent of Code.  It is a huge effort to run this every year.
