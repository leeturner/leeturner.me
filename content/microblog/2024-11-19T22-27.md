This is a great post on the current state of Kotlin Script.  This section was music to my ears

We will continue to develop the `.main.kts` script type, which is already helpful for simple automation tasks. We have
plans to extend its functionality and streamline IDE support. Such scripts continue to be supported out of the box in
the Kotlin compiler and the Kotlin plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
