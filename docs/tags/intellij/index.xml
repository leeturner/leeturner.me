      <description>How many times do you need to use the name of the branch you are currently working on ? Entering the name of the branch into your CI/CD system to deploy your feature branch into a staging environment, sending the name over email or internal messaging app to a co-worker who you are pair-programming with&amp;hellip;
I seem to need to do this quite frequently over the course of a working week, and the place I always go to get the branch name is Intellij.</description>

      <title>Tooling Up - Implementing test &amp;&amp; commit || revert (TCR) In IntelliJ</title>

      <description>Like many others, I have been reading about the new programming workflow introduced by Kent Beck called test &amp;amp;&amp;amp; commit || revert (TCR)
When I first heard about it I had much the same response as Kent - why the hell would you want to do something like that? That can&amp;rsquo;t possibly work, my tests don&amp;rsquo;t always pass when I am experimenting - I would lose my code if I did this.</description>

      <title>Continuous Feedback With TDD &amp; Auto Running Tests</title>

      <description>This is the first of my &amp;lsquo;reference&amp;rsquo; posts which pretty much means I am writing about it here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget about it in the future.
This post it about configuring your dev environment to provide you with continuous feedback while writing your code. All of this came about after a conversation with another developer on my team about how to setup IntelliJ to run tests automatically. We were looking at plugins such as Infinitest but it all seemed a little clunky and crashed every so often.</description>
