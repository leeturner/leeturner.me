      <title>Creating a Progression Framework in Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to progression frameworks last year when I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework&#34;&gt;Monzo progression framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea that people within an organisation have a tool to help them grow and hone their strengths along with organisations ensuring they are in good shape, and their employees are happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Monzo progression framework is built using the Gatsby static site builder which makes the frameworks easy to build and track via source control. I have never used Gatsby, but I do have some investment in the Hugo static site builder, and we also use that at &lt;a href=&#34;https://crunchtech.medium.com/&#34;&gt;Crunch&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I would see if I could put a hugo template together that can render progression frameworks in the same data format as Monzo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
