      <description>I was introduced to progression frameworks last year when I came across the Monzo progression framework&#xA;I really like the idea that people within an organisation have a tool to help them grow and hone their strengths along with organisations ensuring they are in good shape, and their employees are happy.&#xA;The Monzo progression framework is built using the Gatsby static site builder which makes the frameworks easy to build and track via source control.</description>
