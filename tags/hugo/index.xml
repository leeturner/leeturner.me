      <description>The Dark Side of Running a Meetup Group I really enjoy running the Brighton Kotlin and Brighton JUG meetup groups. It is purely selfish to be honest, I get to meet lots of interesting people and learn a lot from the speakers and attendees and generally geek out with like-minded people.&#xA;However, there is a lot of admin involved in running a meetup group, let alone two - especially when you decide to set up a dedicated blog for each of the meetup groups.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to progression frameworks last year when I came across the Monzo progression framework&#xA;I really like the idea that people within an organisation have a tool to help them grow and hone their strengths along with organisations ensuring they are in good shape, and their employees are happy.&#xA;The Monzo progression framework is built using the Gatsby static site builder which makes the frameworks easy to build and track via source control.</description>
