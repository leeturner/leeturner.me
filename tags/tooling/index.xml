      <description>Like many others, I have been reading about the new programming workflow introduced by Kent Beck called test &amp;amp;&amp;amp; commit || revert (TCR)&#xA;When I first heard about it I had much the same response as Kent - why the hell would you want to do something like that? That can&amp;rsquo;t possibly work, my tests don&amp;rsquo;t always pass when I am experimenting - I would lose my code if I did this.</description>
