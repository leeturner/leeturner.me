      <description>I was introduced to progression frameworks last year when I came across the Monzo progression framework
I really like the idea that people within an organisation have a tool to help them grow and hone their strengths along with organisations ensuring they are in good shape, and their employees are happy.
The Monzo progression framework is built using the Gatsby static site builder which makes the frameworks easy to build and track via source control.</description>
