      <description>The Dark Side of Running a Meetup Group I really enjoy running the Brighton Kotlin and Brighton JUG meetup groups. It is purely selfish to be honest, I get to meet lots of interesting people and learn a lot from the speakers and attendees and generally geek out with like-minded people.
However, there is a lot of admin involved in running a meetup group, let alone two - especially when you decide to set up a dedicated blog for each of the meetup groups.</description>

      <description>Every so often I like to have a play around with a part of Junit that I haven&amp;rsquo;t used before, and I recently decided to look into the TestWatcher API.
I have to admit that I have been meaning to play with this for quite a while now&amp;hellip;. I just haven&amp;rsquo;t really found a good use-case for it. Given that I decided to quit trying to find a good use-case and implement something nerdy instead.</description>
