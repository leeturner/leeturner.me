      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I go much further, I thought it was probably worth me putting down a few notes about my technology choices for this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In term of website development, I have had experience of quite a few different content management systems such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://b2evolution.net&#34;&gt;b2Evolution&lt;/a&gt; and more recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;.  I have developed plugins and templates for b2Evolution as well as contributing code to the core product back in the day.  I have put more sites together in Wordpress than I care to remember - most of my clients used Wordpress in some form or other while I was working in the paid traffic/SEO industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
