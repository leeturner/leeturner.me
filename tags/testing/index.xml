      <description>I think it is fair to say that JUnit has been my go to unit testing framework for quite a while. I have used TestNG on some pretty major projects where it was already in use (and it has some awesome features) but if I am building something from scratch, I will most likely reach for the JUnit maven dependencies.
This was solidified even further with the release of JUnit 5.</description>
